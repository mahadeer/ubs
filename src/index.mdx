## Unified Build Tool (UBT)
UBT is a command-line tool used to run pre-defined tasks. These tasks can multiple dependent tasks which will also be executed. UBT tool requires a valid XML configuration in UBT required format. 

UBT is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), so it gives us more advantage on the operating system. One source code will be used across all different operating system, Rust will handle the internal while you compile the source code. UBT will not override any permission set by the operating system, it is preferred for security reasons.

UBT has a number of built-in tasks which will can be used in the build file to simply all the tasks. Please refer to the Tutorial or Reference to explore all the availbel build-in tasks. UBT can be used in any number of ways depending on the project requirement. There are few limitations known as we develop, but will be removed in the future releases.

## When to use?
The main known usage of UBT can be,
 - Automation Build
 - Production Deployment
 - Execute commands
 - Folder Management

*Note: It is a tool, so much more based on your imagination can be acheived*

## How to install?
We are not there yet. Please clone the repo and run from build. Make sure Rust is installed on the local system.
```
$ git clone  https://github.com/mahadeer/ubt.git
$ cd ubt
$ cargo run 'C:/somewhere/build.xml'
```
## Basic Setup
Please follow these steps to create a simple hello world task,

1. Create a simple build.xml file and paste the following,
```xml
<project default="main">
    <target name="main">
        <property name="appName" value="UBT"/>
        <echo>Hello, World by ${appName}</echo>
    </target>
</project>
```
2. Save the file and copy the location of the file including file name and extension.
3. Go to the UBT cloned directory and give the following
```
$ cargo run C:\somehwere\build.xml
```
4. You should see output similar to this,
```
Buildfile: "C:\somehwere\build.xml"
main:
     [echo] Hello, World by UBT
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total Time: 3.5253ms
```
5. You are all set to explore.
